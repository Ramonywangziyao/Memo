# Memo Project
### Wish everyone who is away from us rest in peace.
----------------------------------------------
## Introduction
This is an open-source & non-profit & public benefit project. It is inspired by the sudden leave of one of my dearest friend. Hope everyone left this world can be commemorated by his/her friends, family and familiar people from anytime and anywhere in the world, and their story will be stored online forever. R.I.P.

## Description
### Memorize A Soul
This function is performed to upload the file of a soul to the site. This profile can be searched by a specific #hashtag defined by the uploader.

### Hashtag
One #hashtag is defined for each soul. It is for profile searching and the protection of each soul's record so it can only be reached by its nearest friends or family.

### Offer A Wish
Everyone with the right #hashtag can access that soul's page and offer their unique wish. These wishes are not limited by any restriction. Each person can click and offer their wish as many as possible, and they will keep accumulating forever.

### Leave A Message
Everyone can leave a message to that soul, and that message will be shown on the site.

-----------------------
## Goal
This site acts as an online heaven for those who left us. The goal is to build it larger with more functionalities which can help people to memorize their loves and send warm to their family or the uploader.

-----------------------
## Functionalities / Aspects could be implemented
### Language Switch
It is a globally operated site. Every language should be supported!

### Better UI/UX
Welcome any talented designer to help contributing to this project with a better design. Let's build a better place for those souls in heaven!

### Sharelink with share button
Currently each profile is easily accessed. Adding a share button to each profile page and generate a unique sharing link is a good idea!

### Password
Some uploader might want to protect this profile for limited access. A password for such a profile is suggested.

### Personal Docs or Gallery
Each soul can have its own gallery or personal docs shown to the world and those they love. Size should be limited.

### Invite Wishes
This is a big and meaningful functionality. It means each uploader can decide to allow that profile to be shown to the world for a certain amount of time, so on a exploring like page, it can be seen by everyone and everyone can go to that profile, read their story and offer their wishes, how wonderful!

### Offensive Content Detection
The ability to detect any kind of offensive content should be gained automatically and manually. We cannot add more harm to their family!

### Donation
This allows people goes to that profile can donate a certain amount of money to the family who lost their love. It will be very warm.

### Donation To The Site
Currently this site will be operated under the expense of the starter, me. As this project grows, it might exceed my own capability to run. This project needs a donation page to receive funds for the long term running.

### Cultural Diversity
Since each culture has its own way to memorize the dead, the cultural diversity afffected funtionalites could be designed. This way would show the greatest respect to the dead and their family and friends.
